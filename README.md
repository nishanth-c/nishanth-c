# 👋 Hi, I’m Nishanth  

I’m an **engineer, inventor, and dreamer** building the future of **Artificial Intelligence**.  
My mission: make AI as transformative and inevitable as the **personal computer** and the **iPhone**.  

---

### 🚀 What drives me  
- 🔹 **Vision-first engineering** – I don’t just write code, I build systems that scale, endure, and inspire.  
- 🔹 **Inventor’s mindset** – holder of patents in intelligent systems, driver assistance, and human–AI interaction.  
- 🔹 **AI as a platform shift** – exploring LLMs, collaborative filtering, scalable pipelines, and video-text retrieval.  
- 🔹 **Relentless learning** – I thrive on turning curiosity into working prototypes and prototypes into revolutions.

### ⚡ The Big Picture  
I’m not here to incrementally improve AI.  
I’m here to **redefine it** – to create the kind of breakthroughs that feel *impossible until they exist,* and *inevitable once they do.*  

> *“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”*
